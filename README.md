Power BI Financial Performance Analysis

Objective

The goal of this Power BI project is to analyze financial performance across different countries, products, and time periods, using key financial metrics such as sales, profit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and discounts.

Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

Segment: Categorizes the customers into different groups (e.g., Government, Enterprise, Small Business).

Country: Specifies the country where the sales occurred.

Product: Identifies the specific product sold.

Discount Band: Indicates the level of discount applied to the product (e.g., High, Low, Medium, None).

Units Sold: Represents the number of units of the product sold.

Manufacturing Price: The cost of producing a single unit of the product.

Sale Price: The price at which the product is sold to the customer.

Gross Sales: The total revenue generated from sales before any discounts are applied (Units Sold * Sale Price).

Discounts: The total amount of discounts given on the product sales.

Sales: The net revenue after applying discounts (Gross Sales - Discounts).

COGS: The total cost of goods sold for the products (Units Sold * Manufacturing Price).

Profit: The net profit from the sales.

Date: The date of the sale transaction.

Month Number: The numerical representation of the month.

Month Name: The name of the month.

Year: The year of the transaction.

Key Insights

There are months with significantly higher sales and profit compared to others, suggesting that the business is impacted by seasonal factors such as weather, holidays, or consumer trends.

A positive correlation exists between sales and profit. However, high sales do not always translate into proportionally high profits, indicating potential cost pressures or pricing challenges.

COGS generally increases with sales, as higher sales volumes typically require higher production or procurement costs. However, the relationship is not always linear, suggesting variations in production efficiency or input costs across different months.

Profit margins fluctuate throughout the year, indicating variations in pricing strategies, cost control measures, or market conditions.

Recommendations

Analyze Peak Months: The company should analyze months with higher sales (December, November, and October) to understand the underlying factors driving these peaks (e.g., seasonal demand, marketing campaigns, promotions). This knowledge can be used to strategically plan inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts in future peak months.

Cost Optimization: While higher sales are desirable, it's crucial to manage costs effectively during peak periods. The company should explore ways to optimize COGS, such as negotiating better deals with suppliers, streamlining production processes, or minimizing waste.

Boost Low Sales Periods: To maintain a consistent revenue stream, the company should consider implementing targeted marketing campaigns during months with lower sales to stimulate demand.
